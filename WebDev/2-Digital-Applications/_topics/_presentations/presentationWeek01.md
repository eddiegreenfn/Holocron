# Welcome to Semester 2

- Continuing Flask development.
- Developing `A New Homepage`, further exploring Flask, databases etc

note: 
This project is building from last semester, but ok for new students too.
The basic website structure from last semester will be brought across (user management, base template, navbar etc), to focus more on further development. 
Many will be smaller modules of functionality, like a shopping list, resume builder etc.
